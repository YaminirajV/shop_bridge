I used ReactJs to create UI components and I used "https://fakestoreapi.com/" API for
GET/PUT/POST/DELETE requests.

This application contains
1. Listing the inventory items.
2. Add new items to inventory.
3. Edit item from inventory.
4. Delete item from inventory.
After every operation(add/edit/delete) i am refreshing(reloading) the products list component.
